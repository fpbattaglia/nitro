Nitrogen Data Acquisition Drivers

Full documentation for the Nitrogen API are provided in
<installation directory>\html.

See the Changelog for a list of changes in each release.

Upgrading:

1) Uninstall previous driver releases.
   This is not necessarily required, but helps ensure no conflicting DLLs are on the system.
2) Install new driver and software by running the installer.
3) Projects based on previous release may have minor API incompatibilities
   and will need to be recompiled.
